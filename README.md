# 🚀 #50xProjects – 50 Unique Full-Stack Projects

Welcome to **#50xProjects**, a personal challenge to build **50 mini but meaningful full-stack projects** using a wide range of frontend and backend technologies.

---

## 🎯 Goal

To **level up my development skills** by exploring different tools, libraries, and real-world features across both frontend and backend. Each project will focus on solving a specific problem, UI/UX interaction, or backend integration — making this series a hands-on learning portfolio.

---

## 🧩 What to Expect

- 🔧 Projects using tools like React, Vue, Tailwind, ShadCN, GSAP, Framer Motion, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Firebase, Auth.js, and more.
- 💡 Concepts like authentication, animation, API integration, state management, DB modeling, and responsive UI.
- 📁 Well-structured, clean, and documented codebases.
- 📝 Learning notes and reflections with each build.
